# git add

When changes have been  made inside a git repository that you want to keep, youll need to use the `git add` command. 

Items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked  and all other changes will be marked as modified.

Generally, you cant get away with the command `git add .` which will add all files and directories that were added, change, or deleted. 

You can track changes to specific files using `git add filel file2` which will track specifically filel and file2.

You can specify tracking directions with `git add DirectoryName` .
